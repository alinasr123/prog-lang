		  <h2>What is C++?</h2>
		  <p>C++ is the language that is used everywhere but mainly in systems programming and embedded systems.
		  Here system programming means for developing<br> the operating systems or drivers that interface with Hardware.
		  Embedded system means things that are automobiles, robotics, and appliances. 
		  <br>It is having a higher or rich community and developers, 
		  which helps in the easy hiring of developers and online solutions easily.
		  <br>
		   has a history going back to 1979, when <span id="founder">Bjarne Stroustrup</span>  began work on "C with Classes"
		   to add <span id="oop">object-oriented programming</span> into the C language.
		   <br/>
		   In 1983, the name of the language was changed from C with Classes to C++.<br/>
		   In 1985, Stroustrup's reference to the language entitled The C++ Programming Language was
		   published.<br/>
		   In 1990, The Annotated C++ Reference Manual was released. The same year,
		   Borland's Turbo C++ compiler would be released as a commercial product.<br/>
		   In 1998,  the C++ standards committee published the first international standard for C++
		   ISO/IEC 14882:1998,  which would be informally known as C++98.<br/>
		   In 2005, the C++ standards committee released a technical report (dubbed TR1) detailing various features they were
		   planning to add to the latest C++ standard.<br/>
		   In mid-2011, the new C++ standard (dubbed C++11) was finished.

		   <h2>Uses of C++</h2>
		   <p>
		   Uses of C++ is referred to as the safest language because of its security and features.,<br>
		   It is the first language for any developer to start,
		   <br><br>
		   who is interested in working in programming languages.
		   It is easy to learn, as it is pure concept-based language.<br>
		   Its syntax is very simple, which makes it easy to write or develop and errors can be easily replicated.
		   <br>
		   Before using any other language, programmers preferred to learn C++ first and then they used other languages.
		   But most of
		   <br>
		   the developers try to stick with C++ only because of
		   its wide variety of usage and compatibility with multiple platforms and software.

		   <h2>Below is the list of the top 10 uses of C++.</h2>
		   <ul>
			   <li><strong>Applications.</strong>
				   <br>
				   As C++ aids in concurrency, it becomes the default choice for banking applications <br> 
				   that require multi-threading, concurrency, and high performance.
			   </li>
			   <br>
			   <li>
				   <strong>Games</strong>
				   <br>
				   This language is also used for developing games. It overrides the complexity of 3D games.<br>
				   It helps in optimizing the resources.It supports the multiplayer option with networking.<br>
				   uses of C++ allows procedural programming for intensive functions of CPU and to provide control over hardware, <br>
				   and this language is very fast because of which it is widely used in developing different games or in gaming engines.<br>
				   C++ mainly used in developing the suites of a game tool.
			   </li>
			   <br>
			   <li>
				   <strong>Animation</strong>
				   <br>
				   There is animated software, which is developed with the help of the C++ language. <br>
				   3D animation, modeling, simulation.It is widely used in building real-time,image processing,<br>
				   mobile sensor applications, and visual effects, modeling which is mainly coded in C++.
			   </li>
			   <br>
			   <li>
				   <strong>Web Browser</strong>
				   <br>
					   The rendering engines of various web browsers are programmed in C++ simply because <br>
				   if the speed that it offers. The rendering engines require faster execution to make sure <br>
				   that users donâ€™t have to wait for the content to come up on the screen. <br>
				   As a result, such low-latency systems employ C++ as the programming language.
			   </li>
			   <br>
			   <li>
				   <strong>Database Access</strong>
				   <br>
				   Postgres and MySQL - two of the most widely used databases are written in C++ and C,<br>
				   the precursor to C++. These databases are used in almost all of the well-known <br> 
				   applications that we all use in our day to day life - Quora, YouTube, etc.
			   </li>
			   <br>
			   <li>
				   <strong>Media Access</strong>.
				   <br>
					C++ is also used for creating a media player, managing video files and audio files.<br> 
					The example is Winamp Media player, which is developed in C++ language, which allows <br>
					us to enjoy music, access and share the videos and music files. It also has features like art support,<br> 
					streaming of audio and video. It also provides access to Internet radio stations.
			   </li>
			   <br>
			   <li>
				   <strong>Compilers</strong>
				   <br>
				   The compilers that are used for compiling other languages like C#, Java, etc. <br>
				   mainly written in C++ only. It is also used in developing these languages as well <br>
				   as C++ is platform-independent and able to create a variety of software.
			   </li>
			   <br>
			   <li>
				   <strong>Operating Systems</strong>
					<br>	   
				   Be it Microsoft Windows or Mac OSX or Linux - all of them are programmed in C++.<br> 
				   C++ is the backbone of all the well-known operating systems owing to the fact that it is <br>
				   a strongly typed and a fast programming language which makes it an ideal choice for developing an operating system.<br> Moreover,
				   C is quite close to the assembly language which further helps in writing low-level operating system modules.
			   </li>
			   <br>
			   <li>
				   <strong>Scanning</strong>.
				   <br>
				    The applications like film scanner or camera scanner are also developed in the C++ language.<br>
					It has been used for developing PDF technology for print documentation, exchanging documents,<br> 
					archiving the document and publish the documents as well.
