				<strong>A programming language </strong> 
				is a formal language comprising a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output.
				Programming languages are used in computer programming to implement algorithms.<br>
				Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers.
			  </p>
			  <p>
				The term programming language usually refers to high-level languages,
				such as:
			  </p>
			  <ul>
				<li>BASIC</li>
				<li>C</li>
				<li>C++</li>
				<li>C#</li>
				<li>Java</li>
				<li>Python</li>
				<li>PHP</li>
				<li>Pascal</li>
			  </ul>

			<h2>The history of programming languages </h2>
			<p>
				<strong>The history of programming languages</strong> spans from documentation of early mechanical 
				computers to modern tools for software development.<br>
				Early programming languages were highly specialized, relying on mathematical notation and similarly obscure syntax.<br>
				Throughout the 20th century, research in compiler theory led to the creation of high-level programming languages,<br>
				which use a more accessible syntax to communicate instructions.<br>
				The first high-level programming language was Plankalkül, created by Konrad Zuse between 1942 and 1945.<br>
				The first high-level language to have an associated compiler was created by Corrado Böhm in 1951, for his PhD thesis.<br>
				The first commercially available language was FORTRAN (FORmula TRANslation), developed in 1956 <br>
				(first manual appeared in 1956, but first developed in 1954) by a team led by John Backus at IBM.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>1970 – Pascal</li>
				<li>1972 – C </li>
				<li>1980 – C++ </li>
				<li>1990 – Python</li>
				<li>1995 – Java</li>
				<li>1995 – JavaScript</li>
				<li>1995 – PHP</li>
				<li>2001 – C#</li>
			</ul>
			  <p>
				Each programming language has a unique set of keywords (words that it
				understands) and a special syntax for organizing program instructions.
