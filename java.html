		  <h2>What is Java?</h2>
		  <p>
		  <strong>Java</strong> is a programming language that produces software for multiple platforms. 
		  When a programmer writes a Java application,the compiled code (known as bytecode) runs on most operating systems (OS), <br> 
		  including Windows, Linux and Mac OS. Java derives much of its syntax from the C and C++ programming languages.<br>
		  </p>
		   <h2>History of Java </h2>
		   <p>
		   James Gosling initiated Java language project in June 1991 for use in one of his many set-top box projects.<br>
			The language, initially called ‘Oak’ after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office, also went by<br>
			the name ‘Green’ and ended up later being renamed as Java, from a list of random words.<br>
			Sun released the first public implementation as Java 1.0 in 1995. It promised Write Once, <br>
			Run Anywhere (WORA), providing no-cost run-times on popular platforms.<br>
		   On 13 November, 2006, Sun released much of Java as free and open source software under 
		   the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL).<br>
		   On 8 May, 2007, Sun finished the process, making all of Java's core code free and open-source,<br>
		   aside from a small portion of code to which Sun did not hold the copyright.<br>
		   </p>
		   <h2>Why Use Java?</h2>
		   <ul>
			   <li>Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.).</li>
			   <li>It is one of the most popular programming language in the world. </li>
			   <li>It is easy to learn and simple to use. </li>
			   <li>It is open-source and free. </li>
			   <li>It is secure, fast and powerful. </li>
		   </ul>
		   <h2>Why Learn Java? </h2>
		   <p>
		   Java is among the most popular programming languages out there, mainly because of<br>
		   how versatile and compatible it is. Java can be used for a large number of things,<br>
		   including software development, mobile applications, and large systems development.<br> 
		   As of 2019, 88% market share of all smartphones run on Android, the mobile operating <br>
		   system written in Java. Knowing Java opens a great deal of doors for you as a developer.
