		  <h2>What is Ruby?</h2>
		  <p>
		  Ruby is a scripting language built from the ground up for use in front end and back end web development and similar applications.<br> 
		  It is a robust, dynamically typed, object-oriented language with syntax so easy to understand and high-level that<br>
		  itâ€™s considered as close as you can get to coding in English. 
		   </p>
		   <h2>Histroy of Ruby</h2>
		   <p>
		   The first version of the Ruby on Rails framework was officially released in 2005.<br>
		   It was developed by David Heinemeier Hansson as a part of Basecamp, the project management tool.<br> 
		   Providing default structures for web pages, databases, and web services, Ruby on Rails development quickly gained popularity.<br>
		   And being an open source framework, Rails soon gathered a community of contributors<br>
		   who have been improving it rapidly. The second version was released in 2007, <br>
		   and in 2010 Ruby on Rails 3.0 gained additional functionality by merging with Merb,<br>
		   another Ruby framework that took advantage of modularity.
		   </p>
		   <h2>Most Common Ruby Uses.</h2>
		   <p>Throughout its very rich history, Ruby has been used to develop software for end-users<br> 
		   and companies, servicing fields as varied as business, science, engineering, technology, and commerce.<br>
		   Basically, people hire developers or offshore Ruby development projects that need digital solutions that are quick to implement.
		   </p>

			   <li> Web Applications</li>
